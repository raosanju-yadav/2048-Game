# 2048 Game - Python Implementation

## Game Overview
The game starts with two tiles placed randomly on a 4x4 grid. The player can slide the tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right). When two tiles with the same number collide, they combine into one, doubling the value of the resulting tile. The objective is to reach the 2048 tile, but the game ends if there are no valid moves left.

## Features
- Console-based gameplay.
- Easy-to-understand game logic.
- Scoring system based on the tile merging.
- Game-over detection when no valid moves are available.
- Replay functionality after the game ends.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2048-python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd 2048-python
   ```

3. **Install dependencies (if any):**

   This game does not require any external libraries, as it is built using standard Python. You only need Python 3.6 or higher.

   However, if you're using any additional libraries for UI or advanced features, install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the game:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- Tiles with the same value will merge into one.
- Keep merging tiles to reach the 2048 tile.
- The game ends when there are no valid moves left.

## Game Controls
- **Arrow Keys (↑, ↓, ←, →):** Move tiles in the specified direction.
- **'q' key:** Quit the game at any time.
